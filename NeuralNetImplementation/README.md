# A Neural Network Implementation

My implementation of the neural network.

## Supported Neural Network Layers
* FCLayer (Dense Layer)
* Convolution
* ReLU
* Pooling
* Dropout
* Flatten
* SoftmaxCrossEntropy

See [example_cnn.ipynb](https://github.com/liyinnbw/ML/tree/master/NeuralNetImplementation/example_cnn.ipynb) for an example on training MNIST data set.
